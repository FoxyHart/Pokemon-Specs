# Pokemon-Specs
 Project description:
This project is a demonstration of basic Javascript as well as utilization of AJAX and APIs with Bootstrap
culminating in an application to view stats of different Pokemon. The pokemon present as buttons with their images on them. When clicked a pop-up comes up with their stats and sprites.

My role in this project was to write and execute all the code while using Javascript, Bootstrap, jQuery and using 
and API. 
When tasked in choosing the styling I decided to make it themed after a popular Pokemon.
The only difference I would have liked to make was to find a way to utilize jQuery to make the modal body backgrounds match the pokemons type coloring.
There was a lot to learn here and a lot more I hope to learn and revisit.
